# Pathfinding Customizer

**Pathfinding Customizer** is a mod that allows you to fine-tune your city’s pathfinding system by adjusting the costs associated with specific actions. This lets you influence the probability of behaviors such as pedestrians jaywalking or vehicles making unsafe U-turns, creating a more customized and dynamic urban experience.

## Features

- **Cost Adjustment:** Modify the cost of pathfinding actions to change the likelihood of behaviors such as jaywalking and unsafe U-turns.
- **Dynamic Probability Modification:** Increase or decrease action costs to influence how often certain behaviors occur in your city.
- **Real-Time Updates:** See immediate changes in pathfinding behavior with dynamic cost adjustments.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use controls for adjusting pathfinding costs and settings.
